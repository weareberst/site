<p class="text-intro">We respect the EU’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) and this policy explains how we collect and treat any information you give us. You won’t find any complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text.</p>

## Why we value your privacy

We value your privacy as much as we do our own, so we’re committed to keeping your personal and business information safe. We’re uncomfortable with the information companies, governments, and other organisations keep on file, so we ask for only the bare minimum from our customers. We’ll never use your personal information for any reason other than why you gave it, and we’ll never give anyone access to it unless we’re forced to by law.

## How we collect information

We ask for contact information including your name, email address, and phone number, on our website so that we can reply to your enquiry.

We use a tool called Google Analytics. This collects information in an anonymous form, including the number of visitors to the website, where visitors have come to the site from and the pages they visited. We use this information to better understand how visitors find us and how they interact with our website. We use this information to make improvements and adjustments to our website, to deliver a better user experience.

We don’t use native social media ‘like’ or ‘sharing’ buttons which also build profiles of your internet activity. We ask for your account and contact information when you hire or buy something from us.

Occasionally, we might receive your contact information from one of our partners. If we do, we protect it in exactly the same way as if you give it to us directly.
