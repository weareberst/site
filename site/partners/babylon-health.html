## New horizons

Blending research, design thinking and prototyping, we worked with the diverse team to imagine their ideal future customer experience across two timeframes: the next 12 months and a 3-year horizon.

## How might we…?

We started with the immediate future - the next year. Working alongside their clinicians, technologists and designers, we researched, prototyped and validated how to evolve their service to better help patients to recover from common acute conditions.

## A future story

Our next step was to help them look beyond reactive diagnosis and treatment to a bold three-year vision: using their AI-powered tech to promote and enable proactive healthcare. We created a patient story to illustrate how Babylon Health could help someone manage their health throughout four key life stages.

## The difference we made

Using storytelling techniques, we painted a compelling picture of the future for Babylon Health. One that everyone on the team could understand and get behind. One grounded on validated customer needs and in sync with the organisation’s strategic ambitions. With a renewed sense of where they’re going, the team have shifted into a higher gear and are now focusing on how best – and how quickly – to bring their bold vision to life.
