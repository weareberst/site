      <p class="text-intro">James Bates and James Box have worked in the design
        industry for nearly two decades, helping organisations deliver and grow high-profile, breakthrough design projects.</p>
      <p>But their sweet spot has always been innovation and in 2018 they chose
        to narrow their focus and created Berst.​ Born as a venture design studio,
        we are at our best partnering with [The Ambitious]. Those with the vision and determination to make a difference in the world. Those prepared to go beyond the obvious and take the brave leap forward. </p>
      <p>Combining the spirit of a startup with the creativity of a design studio,
        we get down in the trenches and work alongside our partners to turn fledgling
        ideas into pioneering digital products.</p>
